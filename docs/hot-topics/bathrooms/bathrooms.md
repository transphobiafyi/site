# Gender-segregated Spaces

## The Argument
Anti-trans activists focus a lot of their efforts on trying to exclude trans women from gendered spaces like shared
washrooms and changing facilities. The argument that they typically make is that allowing trans women into these
spaces will allow "biological males" to enter the spaces and harm women and girls.

## In Reality

### No significant number of incidents have occurred

Trans women have been using womens' spaces for decades at this point with a staggeringly insignificant number of 
incidents considering that there are likely millions of instances globally each day where a trans woman uses such a 
facility.

### The dangers meant to be guarded against are already illegal

It is already illegal for people to sexually assault or harass others in these spaces

### There are other ways in which bad actors could access these spaces without claiming to be trans

A man with ill intentions could just as easily claim to be a maintenance worker to access these spaces. This would
require far less effort than it would for them to pretend to be a trans woman.

### Forcing people to use the facility aligned to their AGAB would create the same loophole

If trans people were forced to use the facility associated with their assigned gender at birth, a man with ill
intentions could just as easily claim they're a trans man as they're entering a womens' washroom.

### A ban would require draconian enforcement to work

To truly ensure that no one used a facility that didn't align with their AGAB we would need to implement draconian
access controls on washrooms complete with some form of identity verification each time a person wanted to use that
facility.
